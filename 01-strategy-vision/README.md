# Strategy & Vision

This section defines the foundation for all product work. Strategy and vision establish the "why" and "where"—the purpose of the product, who it serves, and the direction it's heading. Every other section in this repository builds on or references back to what's defined here.

---

## Purpose

Strategy and vision answer fundamental questions:
- What problem are we solving and for whom?
- What is our unique perspective on this space?
- Where do we want to be in 1, 3, and 5 years?
- How do we win against alternatives?

Without clear answers, teams make disconnected decisions. With them, everyone aligns toward the same outcome.

---

## What Belongs Here

- **Product vision** — The future state we're working toward
- **Product strategy** — How we'll get there and where we'll focus
- **Positioning** — How we differentiate from alternatives
- **Personas** — Who we're building for and what they need

## Connection to Other Sections

Strategy and vision sit at the top of the product management hierarchy. They inform and constrain everything downstream:

| Section | How Strategy Connects |
|---------|----------------------|
| [Goals & Metrics](../03-goals-metrics/) | Goals operationalize the strategy into measurable outcomes |
| [Market Research](../02-market-research/) | Market insights validate and refine strategic assumptions |
| [User Research](../04-user-research/) | User understanding shapes personas and validates positioning |
| [Opportunity Solution Trees](../06-opportunity-solution-trees/) | Opportunities are evaluated against strategic priorities |
| [Feature Specs](../09-feature-specs/) | Features must trace back to strategic objectives |
| [Roadmap](../10-roadmap/) | Roadmap is the strategy expressed as a sequence of deliverables |
| [Decisions](../11-decisions/) | Major decisions reference strategic context |

## When to Update

Strategy is not static but should be stable. Revisit when:
- Market conditions shift significantly
- User research reveals fundamental misunderstandings
- Business objectives change
- Quarterly/annual planning cycles

Avoid changing strategy reactively. If every new input changes direction, the strategy isn't providing its intended value—clarity and focus.
