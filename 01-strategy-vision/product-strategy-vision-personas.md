# Product Strategy, Vision & Personas

## Product Vision

**The future state we're working toward.**

A calendar that intelligently adapts to life—merging work and personal time into one unified experience that helps users take control of their schedule rather than be controlled by it.

### Core Vision Principles

- **Unified life management** — Merge personal and work calendars into one coherent view without losing context separation
- **Intelligent adaptation** — Predict changes and proactively adjust events and meetings when circumstances shift
- **Time ownership** — Enable optimal use of time across email handling, meetings, and deep work
- **Framework flexibility** — Support established time management methods (calendar blocking, yesterbox, pomodoro) without forcing a single approach
- **Effortless speed** — Allow users to quickly change their schedule at a moment's notice with minimal friction

### What Success Looks Like

Users feel in control of their time. They spend less effort managing their calendar and more time on what matters. The calendar becomes a trusted assistant rather than a passive grid of appointments.

## Product Strategy

**How we'll achieve the vision and where we'll focus.**

### Strategic Focus

**Primary target: Freelancers and solopreneurs.**

This segment is underserved by enterprise tools (too complex) and consumer apps (too basic). They need professional-grade scheduling with the simplicity of personal calendar apps.

### Go-to-Market Approach

| Phase | Focus | Objective |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Launch** | Free tier with core calendar management | Build user base and validate product-market fit |
| **Growth** | Smart time-saving features (paid) | Convert engaged users to paying customers |
| **Expansion** | Specialized freelancer tools | Deepen value for target segment |

### Strategic Bets

1. **Freemium conversion** — A generous free tier drives adoption; intelligent features drive conversion
2. **Freelancer specialization** — Deep focus on one segment beats shallow coverage of many
3. **AI as enabler, not gimmick** — Predictive features should save time, not create complexity

### Where We Won't Compete

- Enterprise sales and complex team hierarchies
- Full project management (we complement, not replace)
- Social/shared family calendars as primary use case

## Positioning

**How we differentiate from alternatives.**

### Core Differentiation

| Dimension | Our Position |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Intelligence** | AI-driven behavior that predicts and adjusts—not just displays |
| **Simplicity** | Fast, reliable, and focused—no feature bloat |
| **Life integration** | Clear separation of work and personal, unified in one place |

### Against Alternatives

| Competitor Type | Their Approach | Our Differentiation |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Google/Apple Calendar** | Free, basic, passive display | Intelligent adaptation and time management |
| **Calendly/Cal.com** | Scheduling links for others to book | Full calendar experience, not just booking |
| **Motion/Reclaim** | AI-heavy, higher price | Simpler, more affordable, freelancer-focused |
| **Notion Calendar** | Tied to Notion ecosystem | Standalone value, no ecosystem lock-in |

### Positioning Statement

For freelancers and solopreneurs who struggle to balance client work with personal life, our calendar is a lightweight, intelligent scheduling tool that adapts to how they actually work—unlike enterprise tools that add complexity or basic calendars that just display events.

## User Personas

**Who we're building for and what they need.**

### Primary Persona: Freelancers & Solopreneurs

**Who they are:**
- Independent professionals managing their own time
- Mix of client work, admin tasks, and personal life
- Often work across multiple projects and clients

**What they need:**
- Client booking and availability sharing
- Integration with invoicing and payment tools
- Clear visibility into billable vs. non-billable time
- Flexibility to shift schedule quickly when priorities change

**Pain points:**
- Enterprise tools are overkill and expensive
- Basic calendars don't support their workflow
- Context-switching between work modes is exhausting
- Scheduling with clients is manual and time-consuming

### Secondary Persona: Busy Professionals

**Who they are:**
- Employees with heavy meeting loads
- Often work across time zones
- Need to protect focus time from meeting creep

**What they need:**
- Efficient meeting scheduling
- Integration with work tools (Slack, email, video)
- Cross-timezone support
- Boundaries between work and personal time

**Pain points:**
- Calendar is controlled by others' meeting requests
- No time for deep work
- Work bleeds into personal time
- Too many tools to manage schedule

### Tertiary Persona: Families

**Who they are:**
- Households coordinating multiple schedules
- Parents managing kids' activities alongside work
- Need shared visibility without oversharing

**What they need:**
- Shared calendars with selective visibility
- Event coordination and reminders
- Simple interface for all family members

**Pain points:**
- Missed events due to poor coordination
- Difficulty seeing everyone's availability
- Too complex for non-technical family members

*Note: Families are a secondary consideration. We won't optimize for this segment initially but will ensure we don't exclude them.*

## Strategic Questions to Revisit

These questions should be re-evaluated quarterly or when significant new information emerges:

1. Is freelancer focus too narrow or appropriately specific?
2. Are AI features differentiating enough to justify development investment?
3. Is freemium the right model or should we consider alternatives?
4. When (if ever) should we expand to team/enterprise features?
