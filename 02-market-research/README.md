# Market Research

This section provides a comprehensive view of the external market landscape. Understanding the competitive environment, industry dynamics, and pricing norms is essential for making informed product decisions and identifying where our product can differentiate.

## Purpose

Market research answers critical questions:
- Who are we competing against and what are their strengths/weaknesses?
- How big is the market and where is it heading?
- What do customers expect to pay and what pricing models work?

This intelligence feeds directly into strategy, positioning, and roadmap planning.

## Sections

### Competitive Analysis
Profiles of direct and indirect competitors. Understanding what others offer helps identify gaps in the market, avoid feature parity traps, and find differentiation opportunities. Each profile examines positioning, target audience, key features, strengths, and weaknesses.

### Industry Reports
Third-party research on market size, growth projections, and macro trends. These reports provide an objective view of the market opportunity and validate (or challenge) our assumptions about where the industry is heading.

### Pricing Analysis
Research on how competitors price their products. Pricing shapes customer expectations and perceived value. This analysis helps establish competitive positioning—whether to undercut, match, or justify premium pricing through differentiation.
