# Goals & Metrics

This section defines what success looks like and how we measure progress. Clear goals align the team, and metrics provide objective feedback on whether we're moving in the right direction.

## Purpose

Goals and metrics answer critical questions:
- What are we trying to achieve this quarter/year?
- How do we know if we're succeeding?
- What leading indicators predict future outcomes?

Without explicit goals, teams drift. Without metrics, we're guessing. This section creates accountability and enables data-driven decisions.

## Sections

### Current OKRs
Active Objectives and Key Results for the current period. OKRs translate strategy into measurable targets. Objectives describe what we want to achieve; Key Results define how we'll know we got there. Regular check-ins track progress and surface blockers early.

### Archive
Historical OKRs with final results and learnings. Past performance provides context for setting future targets. Reviewing what worked (and what didn't) prevents repeating mistakes and builds institutional knowledge about realistic goal-setting.

## How These Sections Work Together

Goals flow from strategy to execution:

1. **Strategy** sets the direction and priorities
2. **Current OKRs** translate priorities into measurable quarterly targets
3. **Archive** captures results and informs future planning cycles

The feedback loop—plan, execute, measure, learn—drives continuous improvement.
