## Objective: Validate freemium conversion model

| Key Result | Target | Current | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) | $2,000 | - | - |
| Free-to-paid conversion rate | 5% | - | - |
| Paid user count | 150 | - | - |

Tests the core monetization hypothesis: freemium conversion works when intelligent features drive upgrades. At $10/month pricing, 150 paid users yields $1,500 MRR—gap to $2,000 target requires either higher conversion or more signups. Early revenue traction validates continued investment.
