## Objective: Grow user base with focus on target segment

| Key Result | Target | Current | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| New user signups | 3,000 | - | - |
| Freelancer/solopreneur signups | 2,000 (67%) | - | - |
| Activation rate (calendar sync within 7 days) | 50% | - | - |

Validates two strategic hypotheses: freelancer focus is viable (can we reach this segment?) and freemium drives adoption (does free tier attract users at scale?). Segment identified via signup survey; activation measures engaged users, not just registrations.
