## Objective: Retain users by delivering real value

| Key Result | Target | Current | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| 30-day retention (all users) | 70% | - | - |
| 30-day retention (freelancer segment) | 75% | - | - |
| Weekly active users (% of registered) | 40% | - | - |

Retention signals product-market fit—if users return, the product solves a real problem. Higher retention among freelancers vs. general users would confirm strategic focus is correct. Retained users become candidates for paid conversion.
