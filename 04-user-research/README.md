# User Research

This section captures direct insights from users—their needs, behaviors, frustrations, and goals. Understanding users deeply is the foundation for building products people actually want.

## Purpose

User research answers critical questions:
- Who are our users and what are they trying to accomplish?
- What problems do they face and how painful are those problems?
- How do they currently solve these problems (with or without our product)?

Assumptions are dangerous. Research replaces guesswork with evidence, reducing the risk of building the wrong thing.

## Sections

### Interviews
One-on-one conversations that explore user needs, behaviors, and motivations in depth. Interviews uncover the "why" behind actions and reveal problems users may not even articulate in surveys. Interview guides ensure consistency; notes capture the raw insights.

### Surveys
Quantitative research that measures attitudes, preferences, and priorities at scale. Surveys validate patterns found in interviews and help prioritize based on how widespread a problem is. Results provide statistical confidence for decisions.

### Personas
Archetypal users that represent key segments. Personas synthesize research into memorable characters that keep the team aligned on who we're building for. They prevent the trap of designing for everyone (and therefore no one).

### Insights
Synthesized findings and the research repository. Raw data becomes actionable when patterns emerge. The insights section connects individual findings to themes and opportunities, making research discoverable and usable over time.

## How These Sections Work Together

Research builds understanding layer by layer:

1. **Interviews** generate deep qualitative insights about individual users
2. **Surveys** validate and quantify those insights across a broader population
3. **Personas** synthesize patterns into actionable user archetypes
4. **User Journeys** map how those personas interact with the product over time
5. **Insights** connect everything into a searchable knowledge base

Each method has strengths; together they provide a complete picture.
