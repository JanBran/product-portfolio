## Session Notes

### Topic 1: Project Management Challenges

**Key Points:**
- Juggles 4-6 clients simultaneously, struggles to keep track of deadlines
- Currently uses a mix of Notion, Google Sheets, and sticky notes
- Spends ~2 hours weekly just updating status across different tools
- Clients expect real-time updates but hates sending manual status emails

**Quotes:**
> "I feel like I'm managing my tools more than I'm managing my projects. Every client wants updates in a different format."

> "The worst part of my week is Sunday evening when I have to figure out what's due Monday."

### Topic 2: Client Communication

**Key Points:**
- Prefers async communication but clients often expect immediate responses
- Has lost a client due to perceived "lack of communication" when actually just heads-down working
- Wants a way to show progress without interrupting deep work

**Quotes:**
> "I wish there was a way for clients to see I'm making progress without me having to stop and tell them every five minutes."

## Key Insights

1. Tool fragmentation creates significant overhead - consolidation is a key desire
2. Visibility into work progress is critical for client relationships
3. Time tracking feels like a chore but is necessary for invoicing
4. Async-first communication is preferred but not always possible

**Pain Points:**
- Context switching between multiple project management tools
- Manual status reporting to clients
- No single source of truth for project timelines

**Surprises:**
- Willing to pay premium ($30+/month) for a tool that saves 2+ hours weekly

## Follow-up

**Questions for Future Research:**
- How do freelancers currently handle scope creep documentation?
- What triggers the decision to adopt a new tool vs. stick with current setup?

**Recommended Actions:**
- Explore "client portal" feature concept for passive progress sharing
- Consider integration strategy with existing tools rather than full replacement
