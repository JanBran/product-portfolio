## Session Notes

### Topic 1: Team Coordination

**Key Points:**
- Team is hybrid (3 remote, 5 in-office) - coordination is the biggest daily challenge
- Uses Slack, Asana, and Google Workspace but information gets lost between tools
- Spends first hour of every day in "sync meetings" that feel unproductive
- Junior team members often blocked waiting for feedback/approvals

**Quotes:**
> "Half my job is just making sure the right people have the right information. I didn't sign up to be a human router."

> "We have standups, but by the time we meet, the blockers have already cost us half a day."

### Topic 2: Resource Allocation

**Key Points:**
- No visibility into team capacity - relies on "gut feel" and asking around
- Frequently over-allocates top performers while others are underutilized
- Client deadlines often clash, leading to last-minute fire drills
- Has tried resource planning tools but team adoption always fails

**Quotes:**
> "I only find out someone is overloaded when they're already burned out or missing deadlines."

> "Every tool we've tried adds more work instead of reducing it. My team just stops using them after a month."

## Key Insights

1. Information fragmentation across tools is the core problem, not lack of tools
2. Async visibility into team workload would reduce meeting overhead
3. Tool adoption fails when it adds friction to individual contributors' workflows
4. Real-time blockers need faster resolution than daily standups allow

**Pain Points:**
- No single view of team capacity and allocation
- Meeting overload to compensate for poor async communication
- Tool fatigue - team resistant to adopting "yet another platform"

**Surprises:**
- Would trade features for simplicity - explicitly said "I want less, not more"
- Biggest competitor isn't other software, it's spreadsheets

---

## Follow-up

**Questions for Future Research:**
- What makes tool adoption stick vs. fail for small teams?
- How do successful team leads handle async blockers?

**Recommended Actions:**
- Prioritize "low friction" onboarding and daily use
- Explore lightweight capacity visualization (not full resource management)
