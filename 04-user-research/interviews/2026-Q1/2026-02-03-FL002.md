## Session Notes

### Topic 1: Workflow and Tooling

**Key Points:**
- Highly opinionated about tools - uses GitHub Projects for everything technical
- Struggles with non-technical clients who can't/won't use developer tools
- Maintains separate "client-facing" project views which doubles the work
- Invoicing and time tracking completely disconnected from project management

**Quotes:**
> "My ideal client is one who can read a GitHub issue. My actual clients think GitHub is a social network."

> "I track time in Toggl, manage projects in GitHub, invoice in FreshBooks, and communicate in email. None of them talk to each other."

### Topic 2: Scaling Challenges

**Key Points:**
- Turning down work because can't scale beyond 3 active projects
- Considered hiring subcontractors but coordination overhead seems too high
- Wants to grow but not willing to sacrifice work quality or work-life balance
- No system for capturing leads or managing sales pipeline

**Quotes:**
> "I know I'm leaving money on the table. Last month I turned down two projects because I literally couldn't track another thing."

> "Every freelancer I know is either drowning in work or starving. There's no middle ground because we can't see capacity clearly."

## Key Insights

1. Technical freelancers have different tool expectations than creative freelancers
2. Client-facing vs. internal project views is a common need
3. Scaling from solo to small team is a major inflection point with no good tools
4. Pipeline/CRM is adjacent need often handled poorly or not at all

**Pain Points:**
- Bridging technical workflows with non-technical client communication
- No clear capacity planning makes growth decisions impossible
- Disconnected systems for time, projects, and invoicing

**Surprises:**
- Actively avoiding growth because operational overhead seems too high
- Would pay significantly more for integrations than for features

## Follow-up

**Questions for Future Research:**
- What would make freelancers confident enough to scale to subcontractors?
- How do technical freelancers want to present work to non-technical clients?

**Recommended Actions:**
- Investigate GitHub/GitLab integration for developer personas
- Explore "client view" abstraction layer concept
