## Session Notes

### Topic 1: Project Visibility

**Key Points:**
- Executives want high-level dashboards, team needs granular task lists
- Currently maintains 3 versions of every project plan for different audiences
- Spends Friday afternoons building weekly status reports manually
- Has no confidence that reported status reflects actual project health

**Quotes:**
> "I'm essentially a translator. I take what the team tells me, make it look good for leadership, and hope nothing blows up before the next update."

> "The dashboard says green, but I know we're actually yellow. By the time it turns red in the system, we've already missed the deadline."

### Topic 2: Process Standardization

**Key Points:**
- Team resists standardized processes, everyone has their own "system"
- Previous attempts to enforce templates were met with passive resistance
- Quality is inconsistent across team members - no visibility until review
- Onboarding new hires takes 2-3 months because nothing is documented

**Quotes:**
> "I can't force senior designers to fill out forms. They'll just leave. But then I have no idea what they're working on."

> "We've tried to create templates but they sit unused. Everyone thinks their project is 'different' somehow."

## Key Insights

1. Multi-audience reporting (executive vs. team vs. client) is a major time sink
2. Resistance to process tools often stems from poor UX, not bad attitudes
3. Leading indicators of project health are more valuable than status tracking
4. Knowledge capture for onboarding is an underserved need

**Pain Points:**
- Manual effort to maintain multiple views of same project data
- False confidence from green dashboards that don't reflect reality
- Can't enforce process without alienating senior team members

**Surprises:**
- Less interested in tracking features, more interested in early warning signals
- Sees standardization as a retention problem, not just efficiency problem

---

## Follow-up

**Questions for Future Research:**
- What leading indicators predict project trouble before status turns red?
- How do small teams successfully standardize without heavy process?

**Recommended Actions:**
- Explore "smart defaults" that provide structure without forcing compliance
- Consider anomaly detection / health indicators vs. manual status updates
