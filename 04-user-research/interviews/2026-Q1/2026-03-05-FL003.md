## Session Notes

### Topic 1: Client Relationship Management

**Key Points:**
- 60% of revenue comes from 3 recurring clients, rest is project-based
- Retainer clients expect ongoing availability, project clients expect defined scope
- No system to track what was promised vs. delivered across clients
- Scope creep is constant - struggles to push back professionally

**Quotes:**
> "My biggest clients know they can always add 'one more thing' because I've never said no. Now I'm essentially on-call for them."

> "I had a client dispute an invoice because they forgot what they'd asked for three months ago. I had no documentation to back me up."

---

### Topic 2: Business Development

**Key Points:**
- All new business comes from referrals - no active marketing or outreach
- Has a website but hasn't updated it in 2 years
- Doesn't track where leads come from or conversion rates
- Feast or famine cycle - either too busy or anxiously waiting for work

**Quotes:**
> "I know I should be doing marketing when I'm busy, not when I'm desperate. But when I'm busy, I'm too busy."

> "I have no idea which clients are most profitable. Some pay more but take twice the effort. I've never done the math."

## Key Insights

1. Scope documentation is both a project management and client relationship tool
2. Freelancers need lightweight CRM but won't adopt heavy sales tools
3. Profitability analysis per client/project is valuable but rarely done
4. Business development happens in bursts, not continuously

**Pain Points:**
- No documentation trail for scope decisions and client requests
- Feast/famine revenue cycle with no pipeline visibility
- Can't identify most/least profitable work relationships

**Surprises:**
- Interested in passive income tracking to identify problematic client relationships
- Values "evidence" for client conversations more than internal planning

---

## Follow-up

**Questions for Future Research:**
- How do successful freelancers break the feast/famine cycle?
- What lightweight scope tracking would freelancers actually use?

**Recommended Actions:**
- Explore scope/decision logging as core feature, not afterthought
- Consider client profitability insights as differentiator
