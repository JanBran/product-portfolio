## Session Notes

### Topic 1: Account Health Visibility

**Key Points:**
- Manages 15 mid-market accounts worth $2.4M ARR total
- Uses Salesforce for CRM but account health data is scattered across support tickets, usage dashboards, and email threads
- Spends Monday mornings manually compiling "account health" report from 5+ sources
- Has been surprised by churn twice in the past year — accounts that "seemed fine" until they weren't

**Quotes:**
> "By the time I see a red flag in Salesforce, it's already too late. The data is always 2-3 weeks behind reality."

> "I have this anxiety every Sunday night wondering which account is about to blow up that I don't know about yet."

### Topic 2: Internal Coordination

**Key Points:**
- Relies on customer success, support, and product teams to fulfill client requests
- No unified view of what's happening across teams for each account
- Frequently gets blindsided in client calls by issues they didn't know existed
- Has resorted to a personal spreadsheet to track "promises made" because internal systems don't connect

**Quotes:**
> "The client asks me about their support ticket and I have to say 'let me check on that' because I genuinely have no idea. I look like I don't care about their business."

> "I track every commitment I make in a personal spreadsheet because our CRM can't tell me what's actually been promised versus delivered."

### Topic 3: Expansion & Retention Strategy

**Key Points:**
- Measured on net revenue retention (target: 110%)
- Identifies upsell opportunities through relationship instinct, not data
- No systematic way to spot accounts ready for expansion vs. at-risk
- Quarterly business reviews feel performative — scrambles to find "wins" to present

**Quotes:**
> "I know which accounts might churn because I've been doing this for eight years. But I can't explain it to my manager in a way that gets resources allocated."

> "QBRs are a show. I spend two days building a deck to make it look like we've delivered value, when I should be spending that time actually delivering value."

## Key Insights

1. Account health is currently assembled manually from fragmented sources — significant time drain
2. Internal coordination gaps create embarrassing client-facing moments that damage trust
3. Churn signals exist but are spread across systems that don't talk to each other
4. Expansion opportunities are identified by instinct, not surfaced systematically
5. Reporting overhead (QBRs, internal updates) competes with actual relationship building

**Pain Points:**
- No single source of truth for account health across touchpoints
- Reactive to client issues instead of proactively aware
- Internal teams operate in silos; AE is the "human glue" manually connecting information
- CRM data entry feels like overhead that doesn't help them do their job

**Surprises:**
- Would pay $50/user/month for a tool that prevented even one surprise churn per year
- Biggest fear isn't losing the account — it's not seeing it coming and looking incompetent

## Follow-up

**Questions for Future Research:**
- What specific signals have preceded surprise churns in hindsight?
- How do top-performing AEs currently maintain account awareness without tooling?

**Recommended Actions:**
- Explore account health dashboard that aggregates signals across support, usage, and communication
- Consider "promise tracker" feature to log commitments and surface unfulfilled ones
