## Session Notes

### Topic 1: Day-to-Day Account Management

**Key Points:**
- Manages 12 enterprise accounts, each with multiple stakeholders and active projects
- Calendar is 70% client calls, leaving little time for proactive relationship building
- Uses HubSpot CRM but finds it "write-only" — data goes in but insights don't come out
- Has developed personal rituals (Friday afternoon "account review") to stay ahead, but it's unsustainable

**Quotes:**
> "I'm in back-to-back calls all day. The only time I have to actually think about my accounts is evenings and weekends."

> "HubSpot is great for logging activities. But when I ask 'which account needs my attention right now?' it has no answer."

### Topic 2: At-Risk Account Detection

**Key Points:**
- Relies on "gut feel" and relationship signals (tone of emails, meeting attendance) to sense trouble
- Support ticket volume is a lagging indicator — by the time tickets spike, relationship is already damaged
- Had one account go from "champion" to "churned" in 6 weeks after an internal reorg she didn't know about
- Wishes she had early warning on stakeholder changes, engagement drops, or sentiment shifts

**Quotes:**
> "My best early warning system is when my main contact stops responding to emails within the same day. But by then I'm already playing catch-up."

> "I lost my biggest account last year because their champion got promoted and the new person wanted to bring in their own vendor. I found out after the decision was made."

### Topic 3: Cross-Functional Coordination

**Key Points:**
- Depends on delivery teams, support, and product to keep clients happy
- No visibility into project status without scheduling internal sync meetings
- Spends 3-4 hours per week in internal meetings just to stay informed about her own accounts
- Has been embarrassed in client meetings by not knowing about delays or issues

**Quotes:**
> "I spend more time chasing down internal updates than I do talking to clients. Something is fundamentally broken about that."

> "The delivery team updates their Jira board, support updates Zendesk, sales notes go in HubSpot. None of these systems know about each other, so I have to be the integration layer."

### Topic 4: Demonstrating Value

**Key Points:**
- Struggles to quantify the value delivered to clients — relies on anecdotes and relationship strength
- QBRs are time-consuming to prepare and often feel like "justification theater"
- Clients increasingly asking for ROI data she can't easily produce
- Believes better value documentation would help both retention and expansion conversations

**Quotes:**
> "When a client asks 'what have we gotten from this partnership?' I end up telling stories. I know we've delivered value, but I can't prove it with numbers."

> "I'd love to walk into a renewal conversation with a dashboard showing everything we've done for them. Instead, I'm Frankenstein-ing together screenshots from six different tools."

## Key Insights

1. High-touch account management leaves no time for proactive strategy — AEs are reactive by necessity
2. At-risk signals exist (engagement drops, stakeholder changes, sentiment shifts) but aren't surfaced
3. Internal coordination overhead is substantial — AE acts as "human API" between siloed teams
4. Value documentation is critical for retention conversations but extremely manual to compile
5. CRM systems capture activities but don't synthesize them into actionable account intelligence

**Pain Points:**
- No unified view of account health that spans engagement, delivery, and support
- Stakeholder and relationship changes happen invisibly until it's too late
- Internal meeting overhead to stay informed about own accounts
- Can't easily quantify or demonstrate value delivered to clients

**Surprises:**
- Would trade CRM features for "one screen that tells me which account needs attention today"
- Stakeholder mapping and relationship tracking seen as higher value than traditional CRM logging
- Values "relationship intelligence" over "activity logging"

## Follow-up

**Questions for Future Research:**
- What signals would reliably indicate a stakeholder change or internal reorg at a client?
- How do top CSMs currently prepare for QBRs efficiently?

**Recommended Actions:**
- Explore "daily attention" dashboard that prioritizes accounts needing outreach
- Consider stakeholder mapping feature with change detection alerts
- Investigate automated value summary generation from project/support data
