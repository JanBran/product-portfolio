Client-facing professionals responsible for maintaining and growing relationships with a portfolio of accounts.

They juggle reactive client needs with proactive relationship building, often context-switching between accounts throughout the day.

**Key characteristics:**

- Measured on retention, expansion revenue, and client satisfaction
- Needs to appear responsive while managing competing priorities
- Relies on internal teams for delivery but owns the client relationship
