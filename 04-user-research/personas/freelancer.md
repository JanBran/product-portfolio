# Persona: Freelancer

**Role:** Independent professional (designer, developer, or strategist)
**Segment:** Solo practitioners, 3-7 years experience, 4-6 concurrent clients

---

## 1. Who They Are

Self-employed professionals who trade their expertise for project-based or retainer work. They manage multiple clients simultaneously, handling everything from sales to delivery to invoicing. Days are split between deep creative/technical work and administrative overhead like status updates, time tracking, and client communication. Most work from home or co-working spaces.

**Key characteristics:**
- Prefers async communication but clients often expect immediate responses
- Highly protective of deep work time
- Pragmatic about tools - uses what works, often a patchwork of apps
- Risk of burnout from always being "on-call" for clients

## 2. Goals & Challenges

**What they're trying to achieve:**
- Maintain steady income without the feast/famine cycle
- Deliver quality work while managing multiple client relationships
- Grow revenue without sacrificing work-life balance

**What's standing in their way:**
- Tool fragmentation: time tracking, project management, invoicing, communication all disconnected
- No single source of truth for project status or deadlines
- Scope creep erodes profitability, but no documentation trail to push back
- Manual status reporting interrupts deep work

## 3. How We Help

**Value proposition:**
A unified workspace that lets freelancers track projects, communicate progress, and document scope without managing multiple disconnected tools.

**Key features for them:**
- Client portal for passive progress visibility (no more status emails)
- Integrated time tracking tied to projects and invoicing
- Scope and decision logging for client accountability

**Common objections:**
- "Will this actually save time or is it another tool to manage?"
- "Does it integrate with what I already use?"
