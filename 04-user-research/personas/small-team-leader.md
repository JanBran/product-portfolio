# Persona: Small Team Leader

**Role:** Team Lead or Operations Manager at agency/studio
**Segment:** 8-15 person teams, hybrid/remote, creative or professional services

---

## 1. Who They Are

Mid-level leaders responsible for coordinating a small team's work across multiple client projects. They bridge executives who want dashboards and team members who need task clarity. Days are dominated by syncs, status meetings, and "routing" information between people. Often promoted from individual contributor roles without formal management training.

**Key characteristics:**
- Acts as "human router" - connecting people and information
- Values simplicity over features ("I want less, not more")
- Burned by past tool adoptions that failed due to team resistance
- Stuck between executive reporting needs and team workflow preferences

## 2. Goals & Challenges

**What they're trying to achieve:**
- Get visibility into team capacity without adding overhead
- Reduce meeting load by improving async communication
- Standardize processes without alienating senior team members

**What's standing in their way:**
- No single view of team workload - relies on gut feel and asking around
- Information fragmented across Slack, Asana, Google Workspace
- Multiple audiences need different views (exec dashboard vs. team tasks vs. client updates)
- Tool fatigue - team resists adopting "yet another platform"

---

## 3. How We Help

**Value proposition:**
Lightweight visibility into team capacity and project health without adding friction to individual workflows.

**Key features for them:**
- Single view of team allocation without heavy resource management
- Auto-generated status views for different audiences (executive, team, client)
- Early warning signals for project trouble before dashboards turn red

**Common objections:**
- "My team won't use this - they've abandoned every tool we've tried"
- "Will this actually reduce meetings or just add more admin work?"
