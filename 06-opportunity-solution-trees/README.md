# Opportunity Solution Trees

This section contains Opportunity Solution Trees (OSTs) that connect business outcomes to customer opportunities and potential solutions. OSTs ensure we explore the problem space thoroughly before committing to solutions.

---

## Purpose

Opportunity Solution Trees answer critical questions:
- What user needs or pain points could drive our desired outcomes?
- What solution options exist for each opportunity?
- How can we test our assumptions before building?

OSTs prevent teams from jumping straight to solutions. They create a structured approach to discovery that keeps outcomes front and center.

## What is an OST?

- A visual framework from Teresa Torres' book *Continuous Discovery Habits* and her [Product Talk blog](https://www.producttalk.org/)
- Connects desired outcomes to customer opportunities to potential solutions
- Forces teams to explore the problem space before jumping to solutions
- Maps experiments that validate or invalidate assumptions

## How to Use

- Start with outcomes from OKRs — what measurable result are we trying to achieve?
- Identify opportunities — what user needs or pain points would drive that outcome?
- Generate multiple solutions for each opportunity
- Design small experiments to test assumptions before building
