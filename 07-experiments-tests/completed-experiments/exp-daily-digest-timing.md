# Experiment: Daily Digest Email Timing

**Status:** Completed
**Date:** 2025-12-01

---

## Goal

**We believe** sending daily digest emails at 7am local time **for** active users **will result in** higher email open rates and increased daily app engagement.

**Success metric:** Email open rate from 18% to 30%

---

## Design

**Type:** A/B Test
**Variants:** Control (8am send) vs Treatment A (7am) vs Treatment B (night-before 9pm)
**Duration:** 3 weeks

---

## Outcome

**Result:** Iterate

**What we learned:**
- 7am achieved 34% open rate (+16pp vs control)
- Night-before had highest open rate (41%) but lowest click-through
- Freelancers prefer morning digest; 9pm felt like "work creeping into personal time"

**Next steps:**
- Ship 7am as default timing
- Test personalized timing based on user's first calendar event
