# Experiment: Free Tier Booking Link Limit

**Status:** Completed
**Date:** 2025-12-10

---

## Goal

**We believe** limiting free tier to 2 booking links (vs unlimited) **for** new signups **will result in** higher upgrade conversion without hurting activation.

**Success metric:** Free-to-paid conversion from 3% to 5%

---

## Design

**Type:** A/B Test
**Variants:** Control (5 booking links) vs Treatment (2 booking links)
**Duration:** 6 weeks

---

## Outcome

**Result:** Ship

**What we learned:**
- Treatment achieved 5.8% conversion rate (+2.8pp lift)
- 67% of upgrades cited "need more booking links" as primary reason
- No significant change in 30-day retention between groups
- Users hitting the limit converted at 23% rate

**Next steps:**
- Ship 2-link limit as default free tier
- Add upgrade prompt when user attempts to create 3rd link
