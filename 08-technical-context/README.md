# Technical Context

Technical architecture, constraints, and guidelines for building the intelligent calendar product.

---

## Purpose

This section provides the technical foundation that coding agents and developers need to make consistent implementation decisions. It bridges product requirements with technical execution.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Architecture Overview](architecture-overview.md) | High-level system design and component relationships |
| [Coding Guardrails](coding-guardrails.md) | Rules and constraints for AI coding agents |
| [Technical Decisions](technical-decisions.md) | Key technical choices and their rationale |

## Guiding Principles

1. **Simplicity over complexity** — Match our product positioning; avoid over-engineering
2. **Scalability through good foundations** — Design for growth without premature optimization
3. **AI-friendly codebase** — Clear structure, explicit naming, minimal indirection
4. **Speed of iteration** — Enable rapid feature development for early-stage product
