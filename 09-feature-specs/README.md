# Feature Specs

This section contains detailed specifications for product features. Specs translate opportunities and user needs into concrete, buildable definitions that engineering can implement.

---

## Purpose

Feature specs answer critical questions:
- What exactly are we building and why?
- What does success look like for this feature?
- What's in scope and out of scope?

Specs bridge the gap between "we should do this" and "here's how to build it." They ensure alignment between product, design, and engineering before development begins.
