# Decisions

This section contains a log of significant product decisions and their rationale. Decisions capture the "why" behind important choices so future team members understand context and can revisit assumptions when circumstances change.

## Purpose

Decision records answer critical questions:
- What did we decide and why?
- What alternatives did we consider?
- What were the tradeoffs?

Decisions provide institutional memory. They prevent relitigating settled issues, help onboard new team members, and identify when past assumptions no longer hold.
