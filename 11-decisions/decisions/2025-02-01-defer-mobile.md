## Context

Limited engineering resources required us to prioritize. Mobile apps would significantly expand scope and delay MVP launch. We needed to validate the core product on web first.

---

## Decision

Focus MVP entirely on web application. Defer native mobile apps to Phase 2 after validating product-market fit. Ensure web app is responsive for mobile browsers as interim solution.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Web-first, mobile later (chosen) | Faster MVP, validate before investing | Miss mobile-first users initially |
| Web + mobile simultaneously | Full platform coverage | Doubles development time, delays launch |
| Mobile-first | Calendar is mobile-heavy use case | Slower iteration, app store friction |

---

## Outcome

**Result:** MVP launched on schedule. Mobile web usage at 35% — confirms demand. Mobile app now prioritized for Q3.
**Would we decide differently?** No. Web-first validation was correct.
