# Decision: Free Tier Limits

**Date:** 2025-02-10
**Status:** Reversed
**ID:** D-005

---

## Context

We needed to define free tier limits that allow users to experience value while encouraging upgrades. Too restrictive kills adoption; too generous undermines revenue.

---

## Decision

Initial free tier: 3 calendars, 1000 events max.

*Note: This decision was later revised — see D-010.*

---

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| 3 calendars, 1000 events (chosen) | Clear limits, encourages upgrades | May feel restrictive |
| 1 calendar, unlimited events | Simple model | Too limiting for real use |
| 5 calendars, 500 events | More calendars | Event limit hit too quickly |

---

## Outcome

**Result:** User feedback indicated 3 calendars too restrictive. Many users have work, personal, and family calendars minimum. Expanded to 5 calendars in D-010.
**Would we decide differently?** Yes. Should have started with 5 calendars.
