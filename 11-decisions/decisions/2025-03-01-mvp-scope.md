## Context

We needed to lock MVP scope to ship on time. Feature creep was a risk. The team debated which calendar integrations to include and whether to add AI features in v1.

---

## Decision

MVP includes: core calendar functionality (create, edit, delete, view events), recurring events, and Google Calendar sync only. AI features and other calendar providers deferred to post-MVP.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Core + Google sync only (chosen) | Focused scope, fastest to ship | Excludes Outlook users |
| Core + Google + Outlook | Broader appeal | Adds 3-4 weeks to timeline |
| Core only, no sync | Simplest MVP | Limited utility without import |

---

## Outcome

**Result:** MVP shipped on time. Google sync covers ~60% of target users. Outlook sync now in development (D-009).
**Would we decide differently?** No. Tight scope was essential for launch.
