## Context

MVP was ready. We needed to decide on launch strategy: wide public launch vs. controlled rollout. Waitlist had 2,000+ signups. Team capacity for support was limited.

---

## Decision

Soft launch to first 500 waitlist users. Monitor for critical bugs and gather feedback before wider release. Expand access weekly based on stability.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Soft launch 500 users (chosen) | Controlled feedback, manageable support | Slower growth initially |
| Full public launch | Maximum exposure | Risk of bad first impressions if bugs |
| Private beta 50 users | Very controlled | Too slow to validate |

---

## Outcome

**Result:** Caught 3 critical bugs in first week. NPS from initial cohort: 42. Expanded to full waitlist by week 4. Public launch week 6.
**Would we decide differently?** No. Soft launch prevented embarrassing public bugs.
