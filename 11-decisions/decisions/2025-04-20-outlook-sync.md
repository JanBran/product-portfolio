## Context

Post-launch feedback showed Outlook/Microsoft 365 users as second largest segment requesting sync. ~30% of feature requests mentioned Outlook. Google-only sync was limiting growth.

## Decision

Prioritize Microsoft Outlook calendar sync for Q2 roadmap. Target completion by end of May. Use Microsoft Graph API for integration.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Outlook sync Q2 (chosen) | Addresses top user request | Delays other features |
| Apple Calendar first | iOS user appeal | Smaller request volume |
| CalDAV generic sync | Covers multiple providers | More complex, less reliable |

## Outcome

**Result:** In development. Microsoft Graph API integration 70% complete. On track for May release.
**Would we decide differently?** TBD — will evaluate after launch.
