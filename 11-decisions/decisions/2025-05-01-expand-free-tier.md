# Decision: Expand Free Tier to 5 Calendars

**Date:** 2025-05-01

## Context

User feedback on D-005 (3 calendar limit) was consistently negative. Support tickets and churn data showed users leaving because they couldn't fit work + personal + family calendars in free tier.

---

## Decision

Expand free tier from 3 calendars to 5 calendars. Keep 1000 event limit unchanged. Supersedes D-005.

---

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Expand to 5 calendars (chosen) | Matches user mental model | Reduces upgrade pressure |
| Keep 3, add calendar archiving | Workaround for limit | Adds complexity, doesn't solve core issue |
| Unlimited calendars, limit events | Simple model | Events harder to count for users |

---

## Outcome

**Result:** Early data positive. Churn rate decreased 15% in first two weeks. Upgrade rate stable — users upgrading for features, not limits.
**Would we decide differently?** No. Should have done this sooner.
