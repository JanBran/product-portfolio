# Customer Feedback

This section captures ongoing feedback from customers through various channels. Unlike structured user research, customer feedback is continuous and reactive—it reflects what customers are telling us through their natural interactions with the product and support.

---

## Purpose

Customer feedback answers critical questions:
- What are customers asking for most frequently?
- Where are customers struggling or frustrated?
- How satisfied are customers overall?

This feedback complements structured research by providing a continuous pulse on customer sentiment and needs.

## What Belongs Here

- **Feature requests** — Customer-requested functionality and enhancements
- **Satisfaction data** — NPS scores, CSAT surveys, and sentiment tracking
- **Support analysis** — Patterns from support tickets and common issues
