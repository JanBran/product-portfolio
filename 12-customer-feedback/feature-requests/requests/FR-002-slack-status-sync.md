## Customer Quotes

> "When I'm in focus mode, I want my Slack to automatically show me as away. Right now I have to manually toggle it."
> — Freelancer (FL segment), 2025-05-10

> "My team uses Slack status to know who's available. If focus blocks could update that automatically, we'd interrupt each other less."
> — Small Team Lead, 2025-07-22

## Decision

**Rationale:** Natural pairing with Focus Time Blocking feature. Listed as out of scope in current spec. Will revisit after core focus features ship.
**Decision date:** 2025-08-01
