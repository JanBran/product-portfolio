## Customer Quotes

> "Would love a built-in Pomodoro timer that blocks out 25-minute focus sessions automatically."

> "I use Pomodoro for everything. Having it built into my calendar would be amazing."

## Decision

**Rationale:** Out of scope per Focus Time Blocking spec. Focus blocks serve similar purpose without prescribing a specific methodology. Many dedicated Pomodoro apps exist. Does not align with "simplicity over features" principle from user research (TL001).
**Decision date:** 2025-11-15

## Alternatives Offered

- Focus Time Blocking allows custom duration blocks (including 25-minute blocks)
- Users can integrate dedicated Pomodoro apps alongside Simple Calendar
- Focus time tracking shows deep work metrics without enforcing methodology
