## Customer Quotes

> "I don't always have my phone on me but I always get texts. SMS reminders would be more reliable."
> — Freelancer (FL segment), 2025-09-05

> "Some of my team members don't use email regularly. Text notifications would actually reach them."

## Decision

**Rationale:** Listed as out of scope in Daily Digest spec. Low request volume. Push notifications cover most use cases. SMS adds operational complexity and cost. May revisit for enterprise tier.
